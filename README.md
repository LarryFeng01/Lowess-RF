# Locally Weighted Regression and Random Forest

## Introduction

In this project I will be presenting the concepts of Locally Weighted Regression and Random Forest Regression. I will explain the theory behhind the regression methods and then apply them to the "Cars.csv" data set where only on input and one output variable is considered. For both methods, the final crossvalidated mean square errors are reported to compare which method achieves better results.
